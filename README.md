üì¶ **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/jewelry-price-optimization.git
   cd jewelry-price-optimization

2. Install the required Python packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the MLflow Tracking Server (optional if not already running):

   mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   streamlit run jewelley_price.py
   
üèóÔ∏è **Usage**

**1. Upload Dataset**

  * The app requires a CSV dataset with columns such as Price_USD, Category, Target_Gender, Main_Color, Main_Metal, Main_Gem, and Brand_ID.
    
  * Use the Upload Dataset section in the app's sidebar to load your dataset.
    
**2. Navigate the App**

  * **Overview:** Understand the dataset and project scope.
    
  * **Data Analysis:** Visualize key insights like jewelry category distributions.
    
   * **Model Training and Evaluation:**
     
     * Select models in the sidebar.
       
     * Adjust the test size and train selected models.
       
     * View real-time MLflow metrics for the selected models.
       
**3. Access MLflow Tracking**

  * The app logs all model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to the MLflow server.
    
  * Navigate to the MLflow Tracking UI at http://localhost:5000 to explore detailed model performance and comparisons.

üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

**Common Errors**

  * **MLflow Server Unreachable:** Verify the MLflow tracking URI is correctly set in the script (http://localhost:5000 by default) and that the server is running.
    
  * **Dependencies Issues:** Ensure all libraries are installed using the requirements.txt.
    
**Logs**

Streamlit app logs can be viewed in the terminal. MLflow logs are available in the MLflow UI.





**Dataset Overview**

  * Source: Gemineye jewellery sales data.
  * Size: 95,910 rows with features such as category, price, target gender, main metal, main gem, and main color.
    
**Data Quality Issues:**

  * 16% of data (~15,452 rows) were corrupt and removed.
  * Presence of outliers (~804 rows), trimmed using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
  * Duplicates rows(2,589) were dropped.
  * Final dataset: 77,322 rows with 7 key features.

**Key Features Used**

**Category:** Type of jewellery (e.g., earrings, rings, pendants).

**Price (USD):** Target variable for optimization.

**Target Gender:** Primary buyer demographic (male/female).

**Main Color:** Color of the jewellery (e.g., red, yellow).

**Main Metal:** Material used (e.g., gold, silver).

**Main Gem:** Gem type (e.g., diamond, sapphire).
